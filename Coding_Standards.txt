Code Style:
* Everyone download PyLint on vscode to have the same style
* Comments and good variable names!! 
   * snake_case!
* If we think something we wrote is iffy or is not sustainable (quick fix, etc), write about it
* Generally use CS70 coding and commenting guidelines


Git protocols:
* Make a new branch for working on new stuff
* Descriptive git commit messages
* We can make PRs from our working branch and merge directly to master
* Require approval for PRs from subteam (frontend vs backend)
   * Just ask for approval on FB chat
